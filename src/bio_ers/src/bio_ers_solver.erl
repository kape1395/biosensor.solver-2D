%%
%%  @doc Start the solver. The solver is started in the init state, waiting
%%  for a command to run the simulation.
%%
start_link(State) ->
    gen_fsm:start_link(?MODULE, State, []).

%%
%%  @doc Run the actual simulation or resume it, if the simulation was suspended.
%%
run(FsmRef) ->
    gen_fsm:send_event(FsmRef, solver_run).

%%
%%  @doc Suspend the simulation, if it is running now.
%%
suspend(FsmRef) ->
    gen_fsm:send_event(FsmRef, solver_suspend).

%%
%%  @doc Cancel the simulation and delete all the related data.
%%  Use this in the case, when the simulation is not relevant anymore.
%%
cancel(FsmRef) ->
    gen_fsm:send_all_state_event(FsmRef, solver_cancel).

%%
%%  @doc Returns current status of the solver.
