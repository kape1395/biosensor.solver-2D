biosensor (0.6.3) lucid; urgency=low

  * Changes stop condition, based on current gradient. It will fire
    success only after 3 successfull tests.

biosensor (0.6.2) lucid; urgency=low

  * Small bugfix for fallbackForStepCount. Now it works.

biosensor (0.6.1) lucid; urgency=low

  * Implemented In-memory solver state holder.
  * Workaround for initial conditions on corners is implemented.
    This fixes the problem, that arised at 0'th iteration in the
    profiles.
  * TBD: Permissible oscillation.
  * Introduced attribute 'forStepCount' in fallback element.
  * Precision now can be specified for the concentration profile
    output writer.

biosensor (0.6.0) lucid; urgency=low

  * Implementation of adaptive time step adjuster.
  * Implementation of concentration oscillation stop condition.
  * Removed raising of exception, if setting invalid concentration on
    constant bound.
  * Implemented currentdensity subcommand in the bio-output. It removes
    trash, produced by the fallbacks when doing adaptive time step
    adjustments.

biosensor (0.5.2) lucid; urgency=low

  * Reimplemented calculation of reaction in the area subsolver. It is
    now calculated in each half-step in the 2D solver. This makes schema
    more stable (bigger steps in time can be used). Accuracy was tested
    using test/test-2100-nano2d-hiR-dt?.xml, comparing 0.5.2 with 0.5.1.
    Current censity was almost identical comparing 0.5.2 at dt=1E-4
    with 0.4.3 at dt=1E-6 (fails at 88s).
  * Eliminated duplication of the code, implementing the reaction.

biosensor (0.5.0) lucid; urgency=low

  * Implemented one-dimensional implicit solver.

 -- Karolis Petrauskas <k.petrauskas@gmail.com>  Mon, 16 Aug 2010 00:04:33 +0300

biosensor (0.4.3) lucid; urgency=low

  * Solver performance optimizations.

 -- Karolis Petrauskas <k.petrauskas@gmail.com>  Fri, 06 Aug 2010 05:14:50 +0300

biosensor (0.4.2) karmic; urgency=low

  * Small fixes in the build part. It was needed because of porting this
    application to Debian.

 -- Karolis Petrauskas <k.petrauskas@gmail.com>  Mon, 04 Jan 2010 23:22:09 +0200

biosensor (0.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes for reactions on a bound. Previous impmenentation had nothing in common with the mathematical part.
  * Fixed bugs regarding diffusion directions on the bounds.
  * Improved logging.

biosensor (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Source distrubution now also includes cxx/hxx generated from the XSD files.
  * Added program bio-output, it can calculate steady state current density and
    halftime from a current density file.
  * Added support for the overriding symbol values in the model using command line parameters.
  * Added support for different diffusion coefficients for different
    axes.
  * Simulation time is now written at the end of simulation.
  * Implemented additional functionality in the bio-output: ability to
    extract 1d data from 2d grid.
  * Implemented support for reactions on the bounds.
  * Improved support for RedOx reactions. It can now support more
    schemes, not only a+b->c+d.
  * Small fixes regarding error handling...
  * Updated libbost M4 macros (failed to compile after linux upgrade)
  * Duplicate ICursor2D implementations were moved to
    bio::dm::AbstractCursor2D
  * Implemented resuming of the simulation.
  * Fixed bug in generation of xsi:schemaLocation for the model-
    actual.xml
  * Removed empty cxx files.
  * Renamed all namespaces to use prefix http://karolis.5grupe.lt/
    instead of http://lt.5grupe.karolis/. I think there was a big
    mistype.

biosensor (0.3.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some bugs are fixed. Main functionality is alredy working.
