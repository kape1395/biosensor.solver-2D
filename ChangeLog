biosensor (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Source distrubution now also includes cxx/hxx generated from the XSD files.
  * Added program bio-output, it can calculate steady state current density and
    halftime from a current density file.
  * Added support for the overriding symbol values in the model using command line parameters.
  * Added support for different diffusion coefficients for different
    axes.
  * Simulation time is now written at the end of simulation.
  * Implemented additional functionality in the bio-output: ability to
    extract 1d data from 2d grid.
  * Implemented support for reactions on the bounds.
  * Improved support for RedOx reactions. It can now support more
    schemes, not only a+b->c+d.
  * Small fixes regarding error handling...
  * Updated libbost M4 macros (failed to compile after linux upgrade)
  * Duplicate ICursor2D implementations were moved to
    bio::dm::AbstractCursor2D
  * Implemented resuming of the simulation.
  * Fixed bug in generation of xsi:schemaLocation for the model-
    actual.xml
